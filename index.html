        <h2>Getting There</h2>
        <h3>By car</h3>
        For pick-up and drop-off, the main entrance to New College is down a dead end on Holywell Street (OX1 3BN on your sat nav). The main entrance for the Bodleian Library is on Catte Street - also a dead end (OX1 3BG). Unfortunately, Oxford is not a very car-friendly town and New College is not able to provide parking. The closest car park is the on-street parking on Broad Street, but space is limited. We would recommend the Gloucester Green underground car park (marked on the map), or one of the other council car parks <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk/directory/8/car_parks_in_oxford/category/53/categoryInfo/10" target="_blank">detailed here</a>.
        <p>Please note that traffic coming into Oxford can be unpredictable so please plan ahead, or consider an alternative method of transport. <b>Note also that the Wilderness Festival will be taking place in Cornbury Park during this weekend and may impact traffic in the area.</b></p>

        <h3>By coach</h3>
        <b>Recommended.</b> Coaches stop on the High Street by Queens Lane (marked on the map), a c5-10 minute walk from New College and the Bodleian Library. There are 2 coaches that run from London, the <a href="http://x90.oxfordbus.co.uk" target="_blank">X90</a>  and the <a href="http://www.oxfordtube.com/" target="_blank">Oxford Tube</a>. The X90 is slightly faster, has more legroom, and takes a slightly different route through London (going via Baker Street). The Oxford Tube runs slightly more frequently, and runs through the whole night every hour, while the X90 pauses between midnight and 4.30am. Both have similar prices, mobile ticketing apps and free WiFi. Journey time is c1.5-2 hours but varies depending on time of day, traffic, and which stop in London you use.

        <h3>By train</h3>
        <b>The train line between Didcot Parkway and Oxford will be shut from 30 July to 15 August.</b> A replacement bus service for this part of the London Paddington-Oxford line will be run instead. As a result, the journey from London will take around an hour and a half rather than the usual hour. The last bus from Oxford on the evening of 6 August will leave from the train station at 22:56, to catch the 23:31 train from Didcot Parkway, arriving in London Paddington at 00:33.

        <h3>By plane</h3>
        London Heathrow is by far the closest airport. The <a href="http://airline.oxfordbus.co.uk" target="_blank">Airline coach</a> runs from Heathrow Central Bus Station (Terminals 2/3), also picking up passengers at Terminal 5. Arrivals at Terminal 4 will have to either take a free shuttle train to Terminals 2/3 or a free bus to Terminal 5 (buses 482 and 490 from bus stop 7). This coach also stops on High Street/Queens Lane (see coach travel above). Journey time is c1 hour but varies with traffic.

        <h3>By bicycle</h3>
        Oxford is a very cycle-friendly city, and New College has abundant bicycle racks. Although the College is safer than locking up on the street, bicycle theft is common so please use a good lock and always lock your bicycle to a rack or other fixed object. Please do not lean your bicycle on any walls in College. Please bear in mind that the College is shut in the evenings (but porters are present 24 hours), so you may want to relocate your bicycle to Broad Street or elsewhere prior to the main reception.

        <h2>Accommodation</h2>
        Oxford has a variety of hotels, hostels and B&Bs. Some colleges also offer affordable accommodation. Public buses are available if you are staying further from the city centre. Taxis are also affordable and Oxford has a variety of taxi companies - ask if your accommodation provider has a preferred one. Alternatively, we recommend using <a href="http://www.royal-cars.com" target="_blank">Royal Cars</a> (01865 777 333 or 01865 778 866).
        <p>

        <h2>Suggested Activities</h2>
        <h3>Tours</h3>
        We are offering 2 separate tours for guests: a walking tour of Oxford, and a tour of the <a href="http://fandomobsessed.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/duke-humphreys-library02.jpg" target="_blank">Duke Humfrey's Library</a>. The walking tour will take place in the break between the ceremony and the main reception. The tour of the Duke Humfrey's will take place just before dinner in the Divinity School.
        <p><b>If you haven't already, please <a href="mailto:jevremovicwright@gmail.com?Subject=Tours" target="_blank">email us</a> to let us know if you are interested in either of the tours.</b></p>
        <h3>Museums</h3>
        Oxford hosts a variety of world-class museums, all within walking distance in the city centre. We would highlight the following:<br />
        <a href="http://http://www.ashmolean.org/" target="_blank">The Ashmolean</a> - Oxford's premier museum of Art and Archaeology. A mini British Museum.<br />
        <a href="http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank">The Natural History Museum</a> - housing dinosaurs, dodos, and swifts in the tour, and just behind it is...<br/>
        <a href="https://www.prm.ox.ac.uk" target="_blank">The Pitt Rivers Museum</a> - a unique museum of archaelogical and ethnographic collections. Packed to the rafters with objects from all over the world, famous for its shrunken head collection amongst other things. A must see.<br/>
        <a href="http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk" target="_blank">The Museum of History of Science</a> - a museum of eminently manageable size housing an unrivalled collection of early scientific instruments dating back to the time of Sir Isaac Newton (and earlier), in the world's oldest purpose-built museum building.<br />
        <a href="http://www.botanic-garden.ox.ac.uk" target="_blank">The Botanical Garden</a> - The oldest botanical garden in Britain (founded 1621). A relaxing marvel.
        <h3>Pubs</h3>
        Oxford is (in)famous for its profusion of excellent and ancient pubs. In the neighbourhood of the wedding, we would recommend <a href="http://www.turftavern-oxford.co.uk" target="_blank">The Turf Tavern</a> (tricky to find but a favourite of students, residents and visitors alike) or that old favourite, <a href="http://kingsarmsoxford.co.uk" target="_blank">the King's Arms</a> (affectionately known as the KA). Tolkien fans may want to visit the <a href="http://www.nicholsonspubs.co.uk/restaurants/southeast/theeagleandchildoxford" target="_blank">Eagle and Child</a>. Those who fancy a long walk may want to explore along the river as far as the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/DzfpmUjNDdL2" target="_blank">Isis Farmhouse</a> or <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/V3qgrLyi7Eq" target="_blank">the Perch</a>. <a href="http://www.bearoxford.co.uk" target="_blank">The Bear Inn</a> is one of the oldest pubs in Oxford (dating from 1242). All are marked on the map.
      <h3>Parks</h3>
      If you're after some green space and fresh air, we recommend going to Christ Church Meadow or the University Parks.
