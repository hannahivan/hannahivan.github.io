        Please note map on invitation is upside down (north is down) and not to scale!
        <p><a name="sthelens"></a>St Helen's Church sits at the end of Church Lane, which is off the High Street, in Little Eversden. A postcode for Church Lane is CB23 1HQ. Here is a link to the church in Google Maps:</p>

        <p><a name="longstowe"></a>Longstowe Hall sits off the A1198, north of the junction with the B1046. Its postcode is CB23 2UH. Here is a link to it in Google Maps:</p>

        <h2><a name="parking"></a>Parking</h2>
        St Helen's church: Please do not park on Church Lane. Instead, please park on the High Street, and walk down Church Lane to the church. Church Lane is apparently in frequent use by agricultural vehicles, and parked cars could block their way.
        <p>Longstowe Hall: Plenty of parking available in its main car park. Please note if you leave your car overnight, it must be collected the next morning by 11.30am.</p>

      <div>
        <h2><a name="transport"></a>Transport</h2>
        We have organised a bus to transport people from Cambridge Railway Station to St Helen's Church, and then from St Helen's to Longstowe Hall.
        <p> The bus (which should have 'Richmond's Coaches' written on the side) will depart from Station Road, which is perpendicular to the front of the station (<a href="../img/stationrd.jpg" target="_blank">see map</a>) at <b>13.20</b>. Given this, we'd suggest that <b>anyone coming on the train from King's Cross gets the 12.14</b>, which arrives Cambridge 13.03. The bus will then also be available after the service, to transport people to the reception at Longstowe Hall. But <b>please do</b> let us know if you will be using the bus for either of these legs - we need to make sure there are enough seats!
        <p> At the end of the night taxis will need to be ordered in order to leave Longstowe Hall.
